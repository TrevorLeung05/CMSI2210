Total possible points        90 points

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 74.0/ 90.0 which is 82.22% which is a B-minus

SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 4: this won't work; you aren't loading from the proper port,  you
   have no variables to hold values for the computation, and adding one to
   the accumulator will keep it incrementing so that you will never execute
   the "jz done" instruction so it's an infinite loop.  There is no "HLT"
   instruction in Stanley/Penguin either.

problem 5: correct assembly of incorrect source program.

problem 6: this is pretty close, but you don't need to worry about the
   ordering of the values, since the algorithm handles that for you.  Also
   there is no "JN", "HLT" or "OUT" instruction in the language.  Finally
   you don't calculate the GCD using subtraction, you use MOD.

problem 7: the first instruction loads the value at 0x30AA into the accumulator
   so the accumulator value you are trying to swap with is immediately lost.

problem 8: there is no "JGE" instruction in the language.

Not bad but pay attention to what is actually IN the language, as well as the
LOGIC of the programming flow....

========================================================
SEMESTER SCORE SO FAR:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  95.00% of  5 points =  4.75 points
   homework03 ~  75.68% of  5 points =  3.78 points
   homework04 ~  82.22% of  5 points =  4.11 points
                                total: 17.64 out of 20.0 = 88.21%
                                which is a B-plus

Keep up the good work!
