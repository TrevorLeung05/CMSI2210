**1. What is a "computer system"?**
A computer system consists of both hardware, such as CPU's and motherboards, and software, such as operating systems, working together to create a fluid environment where you can complete various tasks. 

**2.What are some of the parts of a computer system?**
Some of the hardware includes circuitry, motherboards, daughterboards, and chips. This hardware contains microcode, utilizing the internal software in the hardware to work.

**3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?**
Compiled languages transaltes the entire source code into machine code. Interpreted languages just run the translated code one line at a time.

**4. Is C a compiled language?**
C is a compiled language, as it has a compiler to translate source code into assembly code, which in turn an assembler translates into machine language.

**5. Who invented the 'C' language?**
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

**6. How long has C been in use?**
The first version of the language C was released in 1972.

**7. Is a compiler a translator?**
Yes! a compiler translates a higher level language such as python into assembly language. 

**8. Is an assembler a translator?**
Yes, as an assembler is a translator that translate assembly code into machine language.

**9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?**
ls

**10. What does the C function atof() do?**
atof() is a function in C that converts a string of numbers into a floating type number, or a double

**11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.**
The bottom two layers of a computer system is Digital Logic and Control. Digital Logic consists of circuits and logic gates which perform the most basic boolean functions. The control level contains microcode which helps convert machine instructions to circuit level operations.

**12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?** 
The three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture are main memory, a central-processing unit (CPU) and a connection between the memory and the CPU.

**13. What is the purpose of an ALU?**
The ALU which is found in the CPU executes the decoded instruction. The results may be placed back into the main memory or another register.  

**14. What is a register?**
A register is a type of computer memory in the CPU that stores data.

**15. What is one difference between Application software and System software?**
While Applications Software was written for people, Systems Software is written for computers.

**16. Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?**
No, cmp rdi, rsi is actually assembly language.

**17. How many buses are included in the system bus?**
3 buses. Data Bus, Address Bus, and Control Bus.

**18. What is the decimal value of 10010111?**
100101112 in decimal value is 151

**19. What is the decimal value of 11111111?**
255

**20. What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?**
The largest unsigned intever value that can fit into 16 bits is 65535.
