SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm
   got an error on linking that the gcc linker is looking for '_main' not
      '_start'.  I changed that for you and now your program assembles and
      links but running it gives an error "Bad system call: 12".  Should've
      used 'printf()' functions ~ much easier and more universal.

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c
   this one needed underscores in front of the function name.  I added those
      for you and now it assembles, compiles, links, and runs fine.  There's
      an error at the end, you get a seg fault: 11 but all the tests run.

problem 3 paritygen.nasm
   this one had some assembler errors.  most of them are because you didn't
      put the colons after your labels.  Also, since 'byte' is a keyword, I
      changed it to 'mbyte'.  also, added 'rel' to line 15 to use relative.
      I spoke about this in class.  Now it assembles and links, but running
      it gives a "Bad system call: 12" error.  Shoulda used "printf()".

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c
   perfect!

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c
   makeNBOC.c compiles
   makeNBOtest.c compiles but won't link.  You did exactly what I said NOT TO
      DO in class ~ #included a "C" source file.  This gives you a duplicate
      symbol error when you link.  I fixed it for you but it costs you.  Then
      you needed to #include <stdint.h> and specifically put in the prototype
      for your function.  I did those for you as well, now it compiles, links,
      and runs fine.

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm
   make NBON.nasm didn't assemble, getting an absolute address error.  I put
      in a 'rel' where the two lines needed it at cost.  Now it assembles,
      but won't link without adding the underscores and changing from 'start'
      to 'main'.  Now it assembles, compiles, and links.  Running the program
      gives a seg fault.

SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  92.50% of  5 points =  4.63 points
   homework03 ~  85.53% of  5 points =  4.28 points
   homework04 ~  93.33% of  5 points =  4.67 points
   homework05 ~  98.00% of 10 points =  9.80 points
   homework06 ~ 100.00% of 15 points = 12.15 points
                       semester total: 40.53 out of 45.00 = 90.07%
                             which is an A-minus total for the homework

Great work on this difficult assignment!

It's been a great pleasure having you in class and I look forward to seeing
you in future classes.  Good luck on the final!
